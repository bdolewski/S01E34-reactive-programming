# Swift Talk
## Reactive Programming

This is the code that accompanies Swift Talk Episode 34: [Reactive Programming](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E34-reactive-programming)

##### Extra note
To test this you should open **Terminal** and go into folder ```JSON```. Then run:

```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>
```

This will make the server list all files in it's directory (directory where you run the python's script).
Since you're inside of ```JSON``` folder then all JSON countries will be visible for app.
